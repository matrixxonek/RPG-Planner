# ‚öîÔ∏è LifeLevel: The Gamified Life Planner

**LifeLevel** is more than just a task manager; it's a productivity RPG where completing your real-life to-do list levels up your in-game character. Turn your daily chores, workouts, and learning sessions into quests that build your attributes and earn you rewards.

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. The Core Planner

* **Task Management:** Create, organize, and track your daily, weekly, and long-term tasks with detailed descriptions and deadlines.
* **Calendar View:** A unified view to see your **Tasks** (actionable items) alongside **Events** (time blocks/appointments).
* **Task Categorization:** Every task must be assigned to a specific **Thematic Area** to determine its impact on your character.
* **Recurring Tasks:** Set up habits and recurring items to build consistency and earn long-term rewards.

### 2. Gamification (The RPG Element)

The heart of LifeLevel lies in its gamified progression system:

#### **Character & Attributes**

Your Avatar's attributes reflect your dedication and growth in real life:

| Attribute | Thematic Area | Real-Life Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intelligence (INT)** | Study, Career, Learning | Increased proficiency in mental tasks. |
| **Strength (STR)** | Fitness, Health, Physical Activity | Increased health and fitness dedication. |
| **Charisma (CHA)** | Social, Daily Life, Networking | Improved social skills and well-being. |
| **Endurance (END)** | Consistency, Recurring Tasks | Represents dedication and habit maintenance. |

#### **The Leveling Mechanic**

1.  **EXP Gain:** Completing a **Task** grants **Experience Points (EXP)** and **Gold**.
2.  **Attribute Growth:** The EXP is automatically directed to the corresponding **Attribute Pool** based on the Task's **Thematic Area**. (e.g., a "Gym Workout" task boosts the **Strength** pool).
3.  **Level Up:** Fill an Attribute Pool to increase the Attribute's Level (e.g., Strength Lvl 5 -> Lvl 6).
4.  **Consequences:** Failing to complete high-priority or recurring tasks on time may result in a loss of **Endurance** or other minor penalties.

#### **Currency & Rewards**

* **Gold:** Earned by completing tasks.
* **User-Defined Reward Shop:** Spend Gold on rewards you define for yourself (e.g., "Buy a new book," "Watch a movie," "Take a day off"). This links in-game success to real-life self-care.
* **Achievements:** Unlock badges and bonuses for reaching milestones (e.g., "Scholar - Reach INT Lvl 10").

## üõ† Task vs. Event Distinction

The application clearly separates two types of calendar entries to ensure accurate gamification:

| Entry Type | Purpose | Rewards EXP/Gold | Core Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Task (Zadanie)** | **Actionable** item that requires effort. | **‚úÖ YES** (Tied to a Thematic Area) | Must be marked as **Completed**. |
| **Event (Wydarzenie)**| **Time-Block** or Appointment. | **‚ùå NO** (Minimal END bonus only) | Is marked as **Attended/Happened**. |
